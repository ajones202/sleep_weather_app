# Project Name 
Sleep Weather App

## Project Description

I will design an app to track my sleep with sleep logs and correlate the weather with quality and length of sleep. This data will be sourced from my fitbit sleep data over the past few years. The weather history statistics will be displayed using a weather API. I will be able to manually create logs, update and delete them.

## User Stories

 Users will now be able to either import or sync (post MVP) their fitbit data to the sleep log tracker. They can then link the weather forcast from that day to their quality of sleep.

 Users will be able to gain insight into the effects the weather has on their sleep quality.

 Over time, users can set and acheive sleep goals as well and understand and identify patterns of sleep and temperature.
